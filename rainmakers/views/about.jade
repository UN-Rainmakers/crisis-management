        .col-md.ad-in
          p One day, in the Rainmaking Loft at 1 St. Katherine's Way, London, 7 strangers and not-so-strangers formed a team during a hackathon aimed at using digital innovation to help the public engage better with the UN. This idea inspired us to create a platform to help the public gauge how the UN is doing.
